<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Water Repellent Treatments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stone water repellent treatments are categorized into two main types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based treatments use water as the primary solvent, offering easy application and minimal environmental impact. They penetrate the stone to create a protective barrier against moisture while allowing for breathability. Solvent-based treatments, on the other hand, utilize organic solvents, providing deeper penetration and longer-lasting protection against water and stains. However, they may have stronger odors and environmental concerns, making them less favorable in some applications.</p></p>
