<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RF Lesion Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Radio Frequency (RF)</li><li>Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RF Lesion Generator market is primarily divided into two main types: Conventional Radio Frequency (RF) and Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF). Conventional RF utilizes continuous waveforms to generate heat, creating lesions for pain management and therapeutic applications. In contrast, PRF delivers intermittent pulses, producing less thermal damage while still effectively modulating nerve activity. This distinction in energy delivery impacts clinical outcomes, with RF being ideal for immediate effects and PRF focusing on long-term pain relief and tissue preservation.</p></p>
