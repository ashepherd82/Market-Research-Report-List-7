<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The D-type Doppler Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CW</li><li>PW</li></ul></p>
<p><p>D-type Doppler diagnostic ultrasound devices primarily include Continuous Wave (CW) and Pulsed Wave (PW) Doppler technologies. CW Doppler is used for measuring high-velocity blood flow and provides continuous monitoring but lacks depth resolution. In contrast, PW Doppler allows for assessing flow at specific depths, making it suitable for evaluating flow velocity in smaller vessels but is limited by aliasing at high velocities. Both types are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular conditions and facilitating non-invasive vascular assessments.</p></p>
