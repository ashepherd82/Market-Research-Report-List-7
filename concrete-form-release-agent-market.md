<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Form Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Mold Releases</li><li>External Mold Releases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The concrete form release agent market is divided into two main types: internal mold releases and external mold releases. Internal mold releases are integrated into the concrete mix or applied to the surface of the mold before pouring, facilitating easy release and enhancing the finish quality. External mold releases are sprayed or brushed onto the mold's surface, creating a barrier that prevents concrete adhesion. Both types play crucial roles in minimizing surface imperfections and ensuring efficient de-molding processes in construction.</p></p>
